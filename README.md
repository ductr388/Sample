# About me
## My name is Duc and I am a graduating master student in Statistics and Machine Learning (June 2025). 

- I did my bachelor's thesis with The Public Health Agency of Sweden regarding COVID-19. The trend (number of confirmed cases) for the 21 regions of Sweden was compared to each other and the Nation as a whole using joinpoint regression.
