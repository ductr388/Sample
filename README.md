# About me
## My name is Duc and I am a graduating master student in Statistics and Machine Learning (June 2025). 

- I did my bachelor's thesis with The Public Health Agency of Sweden regarding COVID-19. The trend of number of confirmed cases for the 21 regions of Sweden was compared to each other and the Nation as a whole using joinpoint regression. The thesis can be downloaded at https://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-195688

- I enjoy the process of learning new exiting machine learning methods and the current favorite is reinforcement learning.
